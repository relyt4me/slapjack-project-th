# Personal DTR

## Time Rules:
* I will be working in 45 min intervals with a 10 min Pom between
* Each day of work I will take an hour break at 12 for lunch and 4 for sanity
* I will not code paste 10 pm
* I will start coding no later than 9 am
* I will be taking Friday night off for mental health and welness

## Process
* I will follow the project attached to the repo
* I will be starting each coding day by reading through the rubric followed by a refactor of yesterdays work
* If I get stuck I will research for 30 min, then reach out to my mentor if I am still struggling.

## Commits and PRs
* I will commit after a working function 
* Each branch will be its own feature
* I will use the PR template created for all of my PR's
